                                    TritonWare is a quarterly game jam under VGDC that brings students together to develop their own game. 
                                    As part of a team, I helped create 2D assets including sprites, keyframes, props, and environments. 
                                    We used unity, paint.net, and other tools to create a story-based minigame that revolves around
                                    a theme of nostalgia. We released it publicly on itch.io

                                    I joined ACM AI board as a developer and graphic designer. The first phase of my work involved 
                                    redesigning the main website ai.acmucsd.com. I worked alongside with other devs to 
                                    wireframe pages and implement the designs using LESS and Ant UI Design. My design skills also reach
                                    in marketing where I currently assist the committee in creating social media posts and instagram reels
                                    for their events and educational programs.

                                    by SDSC. Much like other projects, I was teamed up with other student interns to create an
                                    Android mobile application. My role consisted of managing the team's code, github branches, 
                                    UI research, and backend integration. We utilized Kotlin, Jetpack Compose UI, Firebase, and

                <summary>Classes</summary>
                <p>
                    Start early, and often. It's a phrase that's been ingrained into me as a student <br>
                    to who took CSE classes. It applies to any area of life. If you put in the <br>
                    work early, you save yourself time and energy down the road. But at the <br>
                    same time, make sure to balance the load. Only do what you believe you can do <br>
                    within your means. 
                </p>

                <aside>
                    If you do take CSE classes, I highly recommend CSE166 (Image Processing), CSE110 (Software Engineering) <br>
                    CSE130 (Functional Programming), and CSE167 (Computer Graphics),

                <summary>Social Life</summary>
                <p>
                    I heard from several sources that UCSD is socially dead, but I disagree. Here's a few pointers on how <br>
                    to optimize your social life as a student.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you're living on campus, your roommates are the best way to make friends</li>
                    <li>I found that stepping away from work and hanging out with people often helped me appreciate having a community</li>
                    <li>Partying is awesome. You'll meet lot's of people</li>
                    <li>Join clubs and attend their events! A lot of orgs host bonfires, socials, and workshops where you can meet other students</li>
                </ol>
              </details>
              
              <br>

              <details>
                <summary>Internships</summary>
                <p>
                    Unlike a lot of people, I didn't land my first internship until my junior year. <br>
                    It was a struggle and I made a lot of mistakes. I spent many days asking myself <br>
                    where I wanted to go into. Research? Tutoring? Maybe a real internship off campus? I explored <br>
                    each route and was met with only more questions and confusion. What I realized is to just <br>
                    follow your heart and do what interests you. Moreover, don't be afraid of rejection; it's <br>
                    natural. But with time and patience, your hard work will pay off. Don't feel pressured to <br>
                    shadow other people. Your journey is unique so make it yours.
                </p>
